<h1>About</h1>
<h2>The Show is about NYPD Detectives and how they solve mysteries it is mediocore, not that funny but still entertaining to watch, however i would highly reccomend it either way. The main Story revolves around detective Jake Peralta (played by Andy Samberg) who is arguably the epicentre of the story with all other characters playing in less scenes but being equally important nontheless, the show is running and releasing new episodes to this day, it is directed by Melissa Fumero who plays Amy Santiago, the love of Jake in the series </h2><br>
